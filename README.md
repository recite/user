## user: estimate how often a library is used in a public GitHub repository

Count how often a Python package has been imported in scripts on public repos. in GitHub. We take a random sample of GitHub repositories with the main language as Python, tally the imports, and then pro-rate the number by the estimate of the total number of repositories with the main language as Python. 

We use GitHub Actions to incrementally sample and analyze a small set of repositories every 6 hours.
